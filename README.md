# vbnet.periodicfiletransfer
periodic file transfer tool

i personally created this app because i thought it's too cumbersome to manually transfer files from one folder to another at given intervals. this application simplifies that process. it transfers a number of oldest files first based on the limit you set every (interval) seconds. settings are saved when you click the start/stop button so that the next time you open the application, it'll restore the same settings you used.

used: Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 Express Edition
